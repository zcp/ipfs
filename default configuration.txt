a fine-grained compression scheme for the native IPFS protocol 
version ï¼šKubo-0.19.1-Combination-Control-SO2 (all defaults)

The default configuration for Kubo-0.19.1-Combination-Control-SO2 is as follows:

- The initial compression algorithm selected is 6: ANS.
- Compression is performed during upload, and the conversion time for hot data tables is set to 30 days.
- During transmission, compression is applied based on the preferred settings. All data blocks that have not been compressed (excluding path blocks) are compressed before sending.
- The library libhigcompcache2.so: nvcomp, which supports dependency, is used.
- The GPU compression algorithm version nvcomp_3.0.5_x86_64_12.x.tgz is used.
- The optional optimization of the block pre-request approach is available.
- After the initial launch of ipfs, a configuration file named blockhot.json is generated in the ipfs root directory.
- The above settings can be modified by editing the blockhot.json configuration file located at ./ipfs/blocks/blockhot.json.
-The default number of coroutines being started is 10.
